        <p class="section-description2">We built a system on trust. The whole
          global microcredit system is based on trust.
          There is no legal paper, there is no lawyer.
          Grameen Bank is the only lawyer-free bank
          in the whole world. And as we were doing
          microcredit, we got interested in other things:
          health care, housing, energy, education etc.If you are poor, you are poor in health too.
          They go together. Particularly for women.
          Health condition of the poor was terrible.
          The more I came close to poor women the
          more I realised how much they suffered
          from health problems. That led me to create
          a healthcare service for the villagers, based
          on an insurance program built alongside
          Grameen Bank.</p>
